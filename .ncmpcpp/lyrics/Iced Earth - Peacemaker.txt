As the sun sets I ride
With my pistol by my side
I know I'll survive tonight
Like dust in the wind
I'm restless with no end
I'll find the man who sinned
Death heavy on my mind
The wounds will heal in time
My strength will win the fight
The sun begins to rise

Rode in town with a loaded gun
My face is burnt and I'm on the run
The whole damn town won't look me in the eye
Took a seat at the local saloon
Piano man playin' outta tune
A shot of whisky to wash away the pain

Raise my head the man is starring at me
I grind my teath my heart quickly beats
I make my move cause it's time for him to pay 
He stands and tries to ghost himself away
I quickly follow I can't hesitate
My trigger fingers tellin'me he's got to die

[Chorus]
I shot my gun he had to pay the final price
One man down many more to go
I'm justified I just need to settle the score
They'll never take my peacemaker away

Grab my steed and I'm set to ride
I gotta move or they'll catch my hide
I'm only free with the blood I've left behind
I make my journey across the dusty plains
I got a plan to cure my sorrow and pain
The smoke clears and I live to see the day

[Chorus]
I shot my gun he had to pay the final price
One man down many more to go
I'm justified I just need to settle the score
They'll never take my peacemaker away

I shot my gun he had to pay the final price
One man down many more to go
I'm justified I just need to settle the score
They'll never take my peacemaker away
