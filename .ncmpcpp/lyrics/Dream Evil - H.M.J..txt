On my way to kill the Beast,
I met a holy man from the East.
His name was Jesus, son of man.
He warned me about the danger ahead

He was godsend, he's gonna bring the Metal back
And take away the sins that people did in the past.
He came down here to change our lives.
He said to me, while he looked me in the eye:

"I'm the Heavy Metal Jesus! 
I'm the Heavy Metal Jesus!
I'm the Heavy Metal, thunderstrikin' Jesus!
I'm the Heavy Metal Jesus, alright!"

He said to me, "If you wanna kill the Beast,
You gotta be blessed by the man from the East.
So why don't you get down on your knees,
And I will bless you with my Flying V?"

He was godsend, he's gonna bring the Metal back
And take away the sins that people did in the past.
He came down here to change our lives.
He said to me, while he looked me in the eye:

"I'm the Heavy Metal Jesus! 
I'm the Heavy Metal Jesus!
I'm the Heavy Metal, thunderstrikin' Jesus!
I'm the Heavy Metal Jesus~!"
