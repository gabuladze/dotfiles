What do you want, what do you need?
Let me know what you desire
I know what I want, I know my needs
Rolling heads light my fire

I come alive to spinning heads so...

Bang your head. Bang until you drop
Bang your head. Don't you ever stop
Bang your head. Give me what I need
Bang your head. I need you to proceed

Bang your head

I'm feeling hot, electrified
I know by metal we connected
Let's have some fun let the banging begin
And I don't like to be rejected

I feel alive to spinning heads so...

Bang your head. Bang until you drop
Bang your head. Don't you ever stop
Bang your head. Give me what I need
Bang your head. I need you to proceed

Bang your head

Tomorrow it hurts, your neck will be dead
But it's tonight that counts so bang your head
