I rose from the ashes, the remains of a time set aside
he warrior of Eden, found by honor, these two words collide
n and on and on, with glory he came, he saw, he conquered
         
           He gathered his armies, true he leads his Templars of steel
They sought out the dragon, made the enemy bleed, made them kneel
On and on and on, a legend unbent, unbowed, unbroken
On and on and on, a story us born, a legacy reborn!

Hammer high to the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
Call of Hector's Hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior!
Call of Hector's Hymn

Along came the thunder and the hero was set to return
We're haunted by fire, our spirit is now set to burn
On and on and on, the fire and the flame will burn forever
Still guarded by Templars, all the secrets of steel will remain
Cause we are the keepers, and for us this is real, not a game
On and on and on, we follow this need, we came, we conquered
On and on and on, together we fight, together we will fall

Hammer high to the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
Call of Hector's Hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior!
Call of Hector's
Call of Hector's Hymn


Hammer high to the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
