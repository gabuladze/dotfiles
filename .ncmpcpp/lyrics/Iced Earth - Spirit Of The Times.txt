And as I sit and ponder
Regrets I have no longer
But the questions still remain
A world filled with injustice
Division, pain and violence
Will we ever find our way?
I look deep in their eyes
The fear I see makes me cry
It’s the truth we must embrace

You may take me
But you’ll never break my will
My soul is not for sale
I fear nothing
And justice will prevail
My soul is not for sale

This is my commitment
And darkness, I’ll resist it
And if danger comes my way?
Well, I’ll stand firm in knowing
The truth just keeps on growing
We’re getting stronger everyday
If they take my fleshly body
Then I truly am free
My spirit will remain

You may take me
But you’ll never break my will
My soul is not for sale
I fear nothing
And justice will prevail
My soul is not for sale
