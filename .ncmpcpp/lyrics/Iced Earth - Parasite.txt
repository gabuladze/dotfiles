It rises from dormant slumber
Drains life from the host in hunger
Seeding it's evil
Manipulation

Disguised, masking true intentions
Truth lies it's own reflection
Burrowing deeper
Spreading inflection

It grows, swelling in the darkness
Feeding on the host and weakness
Feeling exploited
Our path in turmoil

[Chorus]
In the dark it drains our energy
Devouring for it's own need
Vigilance will fight the parasite
Prevent it's roots from settling
Our minds and bodies strenghthening
Flush the poison from existence

[Bridge]
Inside
It burrows
Divides
It tears us

No more
Destruction
Shifting
New victim

Defeat, cast away corruption
Embrace with a new beginning
These wounds are healing
This strain has lifted

[Chorus]
In the dark it drains our energy
Devouring for it's own need
Vigilance will fight the parasite
Prevent it's roots from settling
Our minds and bodies strenghthening
Flush the poison from existence
